  <a href="../index.html">Back to Homepage</a>
  <p>Bootstrap is a widely-used UI framework consisting of CSS and Javascript files. Released as an open source project by Twitter,
        Bootstrap provides a wide variety of UI elements ready to use. Open up the documentation and take a look.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../resources/bootstrap_docs_3.2/index.html" target="_blank">Bootstrap Documentation</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>For this excercise we'll use use bootstrap to turn our Instacart and Facebook wireframes into real websites! How do I implement Bootstrap?
        Bootstrap is included in the resources directory of this module. It includes jQuery, a javascript library that Bootstrap depends
        on for its Javascript components. To make life easy for you, I've included an empty page with the right script and stylesheet 
        tags to load the resources you need.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="example.html" target="_blank">example.html</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The minimum requirements for this assignment are to implement the following bootstrap features</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../resources/bootstrap_docs_3.2/css/index.html#grid" target="_blank" >Grid System</a></li>
        <li><a href="../resources/bootstrap_docs_3.2/components/index.html#thumbnails" target="_blank" >Thumbnails</a></li>
        <li><a href="../resources/bootstrap_docs_3.2/javascript/index.html#modals" target="_blank" >Modals</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p> And any other bootstrap features you find interesting. Start with the CSS and Components and then when you are feeling confident
          try to implement on the boostrap's Javascript features like the Modal or Carousel.
      </p>

      <p> Look at the screenshots of the Facebook and Instacart websites from Excercise #1. How can you build your pages to look like these?
          How can you build your pages to look better than these examples? Where can you use bootstrap to help you create some of the more complicated
          elements on the page, like the buttons?
      </p>

      <p>So get started! You can begin with either the Instacart or Facebook designs. Make sure your websites have each of the 3 pages specified 
          in the wireframes assignment. In total you are creating 6 html pages, each with links to the boostrap css and javascript resources.
          Make these look as professional as possible!
