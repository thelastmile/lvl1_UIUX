  <h2> Excercise #3 Responsive Design</h2>
  <hr>
  <a href="../index.html">Back to Homepage</a>

  <p>For this excercise, we are going to rebuild our Facebook and Instacart pages to respond to different viewport sizes 
    (mobile, tablet, large monitor). To start, open your finished project from Excercise #2 and try viewing it in 
    different devices using the Chrome DevTools Device Mode tool. 
  </p>
  <p> Here are screenshots of Facebook and Instacart viewed in an emulation of an iPhone 6. 
      Note how the web developers greatly simplified the design to best fit the smaller field of view.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="instacartMobile.png" target="_blank">Instacart Mobile</a></li>
    <li><a href="facebookMobile.png" target="_blank">Facebook Mobile</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: These 'mobile' screenshots are NOT to be confused with the Facebook or Instacart <i>mobile apps</i>. 
      They are simply what the websites look like when viewed on a mobile phone. These companies
      have seperate client apps, software applications that users can download and run on their phones.
  </p>

  <p>Now, while you don't need to copy the Facebook and Instacart designs exactly, use them as inspiration and 
      as standards for high-quality work. When rebuilding your pages from Excercise #2 to be responsive,
      ask yourself the following questions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Do the different html elements rearrange themselves to fit nicely on a smaller screen? </li>
    <li> Do the images need to be resized to fit better? </li>
    <li> Do the sidebar or navbar need to change into a more mobile-friendly style? </li>
    <li> Does the size of the title text need to change? </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Start by drawing <b>wireframes</b> of how you want the mobile versions of your web pages to look. 
      Choose a simple way of laying out the content in the narrower viewport of a mobile device. 
      <b>To avoid losing your work, make a copy of your Excercise #2 pages before editing them for this excercise.</b>
      Then start coding! A good website looks good on every device!
