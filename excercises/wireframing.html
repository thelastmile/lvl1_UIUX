  <h2> Excercise #1 Wireframing </h2>
  <hr>
 <a href="../index.html">Back to Homepage</a> 
  <p>For this excercise, we are going to design and build three-page websites. The models we'll use are an online grocery store
        and a social network. The first step is to wireframe each page. Using pen and paper, draw wireframes that specify the layout 
        of the sites content for each of the pages. 
  </p>
  <h3>'Instacart'</h3>
    <p>The hottest trend in Sillicon Valley right now is the 'on-demand' economy.
        People want to order whatever they need online and have it delivered to their homes.
        We are going to build a mock version of Instacart, a service that lets you order
        your grocercies online.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="instacartDesktop.png" target="_blank">Instacart website screenshot</a></li>
    </ul>
        <p>This application will need the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Index page: like the screenshot above, this page will list of the produce available for purchase.</li>

      <li>Detail page: Choose your own grid system with at least 2 columns and two rows to
        display a larger image and more information about a specific product.
      </li>
      <li>Checkout page: Design a third to layout a list of the produce the user has selected to purchase,
        show the total price and display a checkout button.
      </li>
      <li>Use the sample images provided in the 'excercises/groceries' directory</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>'The Facebook'</h3>
      <p> Facebook got its start as 'the Facebook', a directory of students
        at Harvard. For our second example, we are going to build 'the Facebook' for Code 7370!
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="facebookDesktop.png" target="_blank">Facebook website screenshot</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>This application will need the following:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>News feed: layout a 'feed' of status updates and posts by users. Include a search bar and a sidebar. 
          Take inspiration from the screenshot provided above.
        </li>
        <li>Index page: sketch the wireframe for a list of students, a search bar and a sidebar with links. Use a 3-column layout. </li>
        <li>Profile page: this wireframe should include a profile photo, sections for the name of the student, 
          their bio, their interests and more. Use 3 columns and 2 rows.
        </li>
        <li> Use the sample images provided in the 'excercises/students' directory of this module</li>
      </ul>

    <h3> Hold on to these drawings once you are finished, as we will then be coding them into actual pages!</h3>
